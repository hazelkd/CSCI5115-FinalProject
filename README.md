# CSCI5115-FinalProject
This project was semester long and developed solely by my group mates and I.  
We went through all steps of developing the app, from brainstorming ideas, to heuristic evaluation, to high fidelity prototyping.  
My group and I also performed a lot of user research, testing, and evaluation.  
Final Class Presentation is Labeled "Milestone 3 Presentation", uploaded in repository.
