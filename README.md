# CSCI5115-FinalProject
This project was semester long and developed from beginning to end by my group mates and I. 
We went through all steps of developing the app. We began with brainstorming ideas for our app, going through
heuristic evaluation for our ideas, to creating a low fidelity prototype. We went through a lot of processes long
before we developed any kind of prototype, and then made a lot of alterations as we continued through our user studies,
evaluation and feedback. We finally developed a high fidelity prototype in figma, and were able to get user feedback on our final
ideas.
During this process, we made multiple milestone presentations to display our results, such as our low fidelity prototype, design ideas,
and high fidelity prototype.  

Final Class Presentation is Labeled "Milestone 3 Presentation", uploaded in this repository.
